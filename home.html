            <h2>ManBrary- Read Manga/manhwa Online Free</h2>
            <p>Are you looking to read manga online at no cost? Or are you subscribing to a paid reading service already but in hopes of saving up? Or are you feeling unsafe on the current free manga site? If you can relate to any of these questions, you will find the solution here, on ManBrary.

                If you search about Reading manga on Google, one of the first autocomplete predictions is “Why manga is so expensive?”. Yes, not everyone can afford to read their favorite manga online and ManBrary is created to change it. We are here to make sure all manga lovers can have access to their manga of interest. And that is why ManBrary is free and safe.</p>

            <h2>How To Read Manga online?</h2>
            <p>As manga originates from Japan, the easiest way to read it is to know the language. However, as you are here, we assume that Japanese might not be one of the languages you can read proficiently. But don't sweat it, all mangas on ManBrary are in English for your convenience.

                Reading manga can be different from reading a comic, book, or magazine, especially when it is traditional Japanese manga. The main reason for this is that kanji, the Japanese writing, is read right to left. So when you pick up a manga volume to read, you need to start with the frame (a.k.a koma) in the upper right-hand corner and end a page with the koma in the bottom left-hand corner. Most publishers retain the original format of the manga; therefore, it is important to know this first rule.</p>

            <h2>Where To Read Manga For Free?</h2>
            <p>Despite growing demand, manga is not easily available outside of Japan and once they are, they are expensive. It makes total sense as they are copyrighted audiovisual products/translated works. In the US, mangas cost you from 8 to 20 USD, sometimes more. Not everyone can afford to pay such a large amount of money for a volume unless their hobby is to collect manga. But as we stated above, ManBrary is created in hopes that every manga fan can get to read manga without paying a dime, this site is completely free of charge. To read manga online for free, all you need to do is to visit ManBrary, search for the manga you want to watch, and enjoy reading it at no cost and with no risk.</p>
